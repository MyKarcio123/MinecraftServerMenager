# MinecraftServerMenager
simply menager for minecraft server in python
Initially, I would like to point out that I know that I could do it better without unnecessary tools.
This project does not use the most optimal methods to create a minecraft server manager.
I created this project to learn more about pyqt, sqlite, BeautifulSoup, request.
I'm open to feedback, have a nice day :).
there may be a lot of errors, the application does not validate the location (after manually deleting or relocating files). Over time, I plan to develop it more and more and improve it with new possibilities so that it is simple for laymen who want to easily make a server in minecraft
